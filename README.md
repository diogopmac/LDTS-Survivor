## LDTS_1305 - Survivor

In this game you're the last survivor after an apocalipse. How will you stay alive?

Survivor is a game where you control the main character (the Survivor) in a post apocalyptic arena filled with monsters. In the start you can choose your class, that will affect your special ability that can be used during the game.
#### Warrior: Has increased damage for 7 seconds
#### Mage: Activates a shield that makes you immortal for 5 seconds
#### Rogue: Does a small teleport in front.

The class of the survivor also affects its health. Besides the class you can also choose your weapon.
#### Bow: The weapon with the longest range, slow fire rate and medium damage.
#### Pistol: Weapon with medium range, low damage but high fire rate.
#### Sword: The weapon with the smallest range but highest fire rate and damage.

You have to battle various waves of monsters with spawn rate, damage and health increasing as the player levels up.
When killing a monster the player gets some experience that enables him to level up. Whenever the player levels up he has a choice to increase the fire rate, damage or health. You have to choose wisely to be able to progress in the game and get to higher levels.
